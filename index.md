## Professional Self Assessment
Greetings and Salutations! My name is Jessie Black and this is my personal ePortfolio. I will soon be graduating from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering. My degree has focused on a variety of topics that have contributed to an existsing career as a Systems Engineer and that have helped my skill set grow considerably. In the below portfolio, you will find references to a mobile application that cover the three topics of Software Design and Engineering; Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases. This application was written in Android Studio using Java as the foundation, with an associated Android SQLite Database. In addition to the below application, I use C/C++, C#, Python, and Java on a weekly basis as well as work on SQL Databases and the creation of User Interfaces for our Global IT Asset Management team. My strengths are that I am able to write software in multiple languages as well as work with REST API's, XML/XAML and JSON, and can write customer intefaces for applications in any of these languages. I am able to understand the entire scope of a large project and work with others on a team to complete milestones in such a project while not losing site of the overall requirements. One of the areas that I have grown most in through my coursework at SNHU has been the area of software security. I have found that I still need to develop my skillset and writing secure code, but it is an area that I am looking forward to learning more about as well as  challenging myself to excel.

As the capstone project for the Computer Science program, I chose to enhance and modify a mobile application that I created during the Mobile Architecure and Programming course. The project began as an inventory management application for a warehouse. I chose to modify the application by converting it into a character creation and management app for the Palladium Rifts table top role-playing game. The reason for choosing this as my capstone project is that it incorpates all three categories of Software Design and Engineering; Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases. I wanted to work on a project where all three of the categories would work together to create a cohesive application and as well as begin work on a project that I could continue in my post-graduate career. With that in mind, the project is by nature incomplete, but what is presented below and included with this ePortfolio can be run in Android Studio and is nearing the release stage for the Google Play Store. Below I begin by performing a self-narrated Code Review where I discuss the initial inventory management application, it's functionality, drawbacks and weakneses, and then the planned enhancements for the project. This if followed 

## Self-narrated Code Review
This is the initial code-review that I performed of the Inventory Management project that I created for the Mobile Architecture and Programming course at SNHU. This review critiques the formatting, logic, and general security of the program as well as outlines my planned enhancements for the application for the capstone project.

## Software Design and Engineering
From a software design and engineering perspective, I chose re-design the program following the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. This seperates the different components of the application into the Model for data structures, View for UI components, and ViewModel to handle interactions between the View and Model. This design pattern stronly relies on databinding between the View and ViewModel which allows for updates to the Model without manual declarations. 

The Software Design and Engineering artifact is an evolution of the previously reviewed inventory management application that was developed for the CS-360 Mobile Architecture & Programming course. It was created for the term from June 2021 to August 2021. The original intent of the application was to be an inventory management application for a warehouse that would allow for users to monitor a companyâ€™s inventory, add and remove inventory items, and receive notifications based on inventory item events. I have chosen to evolve this base design into a character creation/management system for the Palladium Rifts tabletop RPG.
I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because I feel that it strongly showcases my ability to design and engineer an entire application. I selected this item because I feel confident using object-oriented programming techniques when designing applications.  Specifically, by applying the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to the application, it shows a well-structured and thought-out design philosophy in my approach to software development. The specific components that showcase my skills in software development is the interaction between the MVVM pattern components to create an efficient application that is well-commented and has few errors. 
Though the application is still in development, I have successfully modified the application to meet the stated outcome and functionality that I outlined in code review video. This has been accomplished through creation of additional classes (Model) to support the process, Views that support the user experience (UX), and View Models to facilitate the interaction between the user and the data being presented. 
The process of modifying the artifact to support the character creation process has been particularly challenging as I have had to scale back my initial intentions considerably due to the time constraint of producing the application within a limited timeframe. Specifically, the content that the application supports is much larger than I originally anticipated. 
I have also included a partially compelted set of UML diagrams as documentation for the applicationa and to showcase my ability to As an inclusion in this artifact, I plan to display a set of UML diagrams that I have begun creating to help myself in designing the application. I feel the diagrams will further support the software design/engineering aspect as they will showcase my careful and intentional approach to the design of the application. They also showcase my ability to create a well-documented application which can be an important factor for many software projects. These diagrams include a Use Case Diagram which helped me to narrow the scope of my project, a two UML Sequence diagrams which helped me to break up the workflow into meaningful components and stages, and a UML Class Diagram to outline and understand the relationship between the classes of the application. These diagrams then are reflected in the design of the application itself and support the MVVM design pattern.








## Algorithms and Data Structure
For the transition from the inventory manager application to the Rifts Companion application, I implemented multiple new class structures to support different data components that are involved in character creation for the Rifts RPG game. These classes all implement getter/setter functionality for access control

## Databases
The adjustment to the inventory manager application for database structure was relatively straightforward. The number of tables were increased to support the different amounts of data that needed to be accessed by the program at different points in the character creation process. The tables contain significantly larger amounts of data compared to the inventory management program and I ended up creating a Java package with classes and methods dedicated to populating those tables provided they are not updated. 

When the [DBHelper](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/DBHelper.java) class is initialized, it first performs a check to see if the different tables currently exist, and then creates them if they have do not. This is done by performing a "CREATE IF EXISTS" query on the database for each table. Below is an example of how the query is structured. 

```java
String skillTableCreateQuery = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME + " ("
                + SKILL_ID_COL + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "
                + SKILL_NAME_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_DESCRIPTION_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_CATEGORY_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL,"
                + SKILL_PROFICIENCY_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_PREREQUISITES_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_MODIFIER_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_MODIFIER_VALUE_COL + " INT)";
```

I would point out that each table name, and the column names for each table are static String variables in the DBHelper class. This supports readability of the code and helps to prevent typos in any SQL queries by using the String variables rather than typing them in. 

The program then performs a check on each table to determine if it is empty or contains the data. This is shown in the following code. 

```java
private boolean isTableEmpty(String tableName) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();
        boolean retval;
        Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(String.format("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s",tableName), null);
        cursor.moveToFirst();
        if (cursor.getInt(0) == 0)
            retval = true;
        else
            retval = false;

        cursor.close();
        return retval;
    }
```

If the tables are empty, then the data is added to the table using the SQLiteOpenHelper functions using ContentValues and the SQLiteDatabase insert() function. Below is an example of the Skills table being populated using looping through the Skills List.

```java
public void PopulateSkillsTable() {
        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
        SkillsData sd = new SkillsData();

        for (Skill skill : sd.getSkillsList()) {
            ContentValues values = new ContentValues();

            values.put(SKILL_NAME_COL, skill.getSkillName());
            values.put(SKILL_DESCRIPTION_COL, skill.getSkillDescription());
            values.put(SKILL_CATEGORY_COL, skill.getSkillCategory());
            values.put(SKILL_PROFICIENCY_COL, skill.getSkillProficiency());
            values.put(SKILL_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL, skill.getSkillProficiencyPerLevel());
            values.put(SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_COL, skill.getSkillSecondaryProficiency());
            values.put(SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL, skill.getSkillSecondaryProficiencyPerLevel());
            values.put(SKILL_PREREQUISITES_COL, skill.getSkillPrerequisites());
            values.put(SKILL_MODIFIER_COL, skill.getSkillModifier());
            values.put(SKILL_MODIFIER_VALUE_COL, skill.getSkillModifierValue());

            db.insert(SKILL_TABLE_NAME, null, values);
        }
    }
```

Lastly, data is accessed from the database using one of two different queries from the application. The first query returns all values contained in the specific table as in the below example for the Skills Table
```java
    public ArrayList<Skill> getDBSkillsList() {
        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
        ArrayList<Skill> skillsList = new ArrayList<>();

        Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME, null);
        int rowCount = cursor.getCount();
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
            do {
                skillsList.add(
                        new Skill(
                                cursor.getInt(0),       // Skill ID
                                cursor.getString(1),    // Skill Name
                                cursor.getString(2),    // Skill Description
                                cursor.getString(3),    // Skill Category
                                cursor.getInt(4),       // Skill Base Proficiency
                                cursor.getInt(5),       // Skill Proficiency Per Level
                                cursor.getInt(6),       // Skill Secondary Base Proficiency
                                cursor.getInt(7),       // Skill Secondary Proficiency Per Level
                                cursor.getString(8),    // Skill Prerequisites (comma delim)
                                cursor.getString(9),    // Skill Modifier
                                cursor.getInt(10)       // Skill Modifier value
                        )
                );
            } while (cursor.moveToNext());
        }
        cursor.close();
        return skillsList;
    }
```

And the second query method is to return one or more entries contained in a comma delimmitted string passed as an argument to the method. This uses the SQL query "IN" method to dynamically select any matching entries for the skillname, but also able to return a single value. 

```java
    public ArrayList<Skill> getPartialDBSkillsList(String skillNames) {
        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
        ArrayList<Skill> skillsList = new ArrayList<>();

        // Reformat the skillNames string to support the IN function of SQL
        String skillNamesFormatted = skillNames.replace(",","','");
        String getSkillsQuery = "SELECT * FROM " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME + " WHERE " + SKILL_NAME_COL + " IN ('" + skillNamesFormatted + "')";
        Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(getSkillsQuery, null);
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
            do  {
                skillsList.add(
                        new Skill(
                                cursor.getInt(0),       // Skill ID
                                cursor.getString(1),    // Skill Name
                                cursor.getString(2),    // Skill Description
                                cursor.getString(3),    // Skill Category
                                cursor.getInt(4),       // Skill Base Proficiency
                                cursor.getInt(5),       // Skill Proficiency Per Level
                                cursor.getInt(6),       // Skill Secondary Base Proficiency
                                cursor.getInt(7),       // Skill Secondary Proficiency Per Level
                                cursor.getString(8),    // Skill Prerequisites (comma delim)
                                cursor.getString(9),    // Skill Modifier
                                cursor.getInt(10)       // Skill Modifier value
                        )
                );
            } while (cursor.moveToNext());
        }
        cursor.close();
        return skillsList;
    }
```

The above method does not support partial matches, but could easily be modified to support partial match searching of the database. In future versions of this application, such functinonality will be implemented for general search parameters.
