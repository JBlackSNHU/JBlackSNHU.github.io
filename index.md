## Professional Self Assessment
Greetings and Salutations! My name is Jessie Black and this is my personal ePortfolio. I will soon be graduating from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) with a bachelor's of science in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering. My degree has focused on a variety of topics that have contributed to an existsing career as a Systems Engineer and that have helped my skill set grow considerably. In the below portfolio, you will find references to a mobile application that cover the three topics of Software Design and Engineering; Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases. This application was written in Android Studio using Java as the foundation, with an associated Android SQLite Database. In addition to the below application, I use C/C++, C#, Python, and Java on a weekly basis as well as work on SQL Databases and the creation of User Interfaces for our Global IT Asset Management team. My strengths are that I am able to write software in multiple languages as well as work with REST API's, XML/XAML and JSON, and can write customer intefaces for applications in any of these languages. I am able to understand the entire scope of a large project and work with others on a team to complete milestones in such a project while not losing site of the overall requirements. One of the areas that I have grown most in through my coursework at SNHU has been the area of software security. I have found that I still need to develop my skillset and writing secure code, but it is an area that I am looking forward to learning more about as well as  challenging myself to excel.

As the capstone project for the Computer Science program, I chose to enhance and modify a mobile application that I created during the Mobile Architecure and Programming course. The project began as an inventory management application for a warehouse. I chose to modify the application by converting it into a character creation and management app for the Palladium Rifts table top role-playing game. The reason for choosing this as my capstone project is that it incorpates all three categories of Software Design and Engineering; Algorithms and Data Structures; and Databases. I wanted to work on a project where all three of the categories would work together to create a cohesive application and as well as begin work on a project that I could continue in my post-graduate career. With that in mind, the project is by nature incomplete, but what is presented below and included with this ePortfolio can be run in Android Studio and is nearing the release stage for the Google Play Store. Below I begin by performing a self-narrated Code Review where I discuss the initial inventory management application, it's functionality, drawbacks and weakneses, and then the planned enhancements for the project. This if followed 

## Self-narrated Code Review
This is the initial code-review that I performed of the Inventory Management project that I created for the Mobile Architecture and Programming course at SNHU. This review critiques the formatting, logic, and general security of the program as well as outlines my planned enhancements for the application for the capstone project.

## Software Design and Engineering
From a software design and engineering perspective, I chose re-design the program following the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. This seperates the different components of the application into the Model for data structures, View for UI components, and ViewModel to handle interactions between the View and Model. This design pattern stronly relies on databinding between the View and ViewModel which allows for updates to the Model without manual declarations. 

The Software Design and Engineering artifact is an evolution of the previously reviewed inventory management application that was developed for the CS-360 Mobile Architecture & Programming course. It was created for the term from June 2021 to August 2021. The original intent of the application was to be an inventory management application for a warehouse that would allow for users to monitor a companyâ€™s inventory, add and remove inventory items, and receive notifications based on inventory item events. I have chosen to evolve this base design into a character creation/management system for the Palladium Rifts tabletop RPG.
I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because I feel that it strongly showcases my ability to design and engineer an entire application. I selected this item because I feel confident using object-oriented programming techniques when designing applications.  Specifically, by applying the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to the application, it shows a well-structured and thought-out design philosophy in my approach to software development. The specific components that showcase my skills in software development is the interaction between the MVVM pattern components to create an efficient application that is well-commented and has few errors. 
Though the application is still in development, I have successfully modified the application to meet the stated outcome and functionality that I outlined in code review video. This has been accomplished through creation of additional classes (Model) to support the process, Views that support the user experience (UX), and View Models to facilitate the interaction between the user and the data being presented. 
The process of modifying the artifact to support the character creation process has been particularly challenging as I have had to scale back my initial intentions considerably due to the time constraint of producing the application within a limited timeframe. Specifically, the content that the application supports is much larger than I originally anticipated. 
I have also included a partially completed set of UML diagrams as documentation for the applicationa and to showcase my ability to create a well-designed and documented application. One of the skills I learned during during my coursework at SNHU is the importance of documentation for large programs. Even though these are incomplete and don't encapsulate the entirety of the application, I feel that they do show my ability to consider the project as a whole. These diagrams include

## Algorithms and Data Structure

### Data Structures
In the area of Algorithms and Data Structures, I feel that I have a strong general understanding but that I am not an expert. I am more than capable of creating meaningful data structures as in the case of the classes that were used in the application. I am also able to create basic algorithms to accomplish the general functionality that may be required in the applicaton. 

An example of two classes that are used in the application are the [Skill class](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/Skill.java) and the [Player Character class](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/PlayerCharacter.java). The Skill class is designed to be held in array of skills for the Player Character to access during creation and character management. The Skill class utilizes private variables that are accessed through the "get" methods and incorporates a constructor method when the class is initalized. The Player Character class is similar but also utilizes "set" methods that allow for the ViewModel and databinding functionality to set values for the Player Characer object that is in use. 

### Algorithms
The logical flow of the character creatoin process requires multiple algorithms to determine character attributes, available selection of items and skills, and will later incorporate a search function. Provided below are two examples of the algorithms used in the application.

The first example is a simple random number generator for the character attributes. This algorithm is found in the [PlayerCharacterAttributesActivity](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/PlayerCharacterAttributesActivity.java) .In the course of creating a character, eight attributes are assigned values by rolling four six sided dice and discarding the lowest value. This algorithm simulates the dice roll by obtaining four random numbers between 1 and 6 and then takes the sum of the three highest numbers. There is an additional clause the allows for one additional dice roll if the total of the three highest rolls is 17 or 18. The algorithm performs this simulated dice roll 8 times and then sets the each of the eight character attributes those values. 

```java
public void GenerateAttributeRolls() {
    int[] randomRolls = new int[8];
    int min = 1;
    int max = 6;
    for (int i = 0; i < randomRolls.length; i++) {
        int[] rolls = new int[4];

        // Loop assigning random values to the rolls array
        for (int r = 0; r < rolls.length; r++) {
            rolls[r] = (int)(Math.random()*(max-min+1)+min);
        }
        // Using the Arrays.sort function to set the lowest value to index 0
        Arrays.sort(rolls);

        // Sum the three highest values from the rolls array
        // which are now indices 1-3 thanks to the Arrays.sort method.
        int totalRoll = rolls[1] + rolls[2] + rolls[3];
        // If the total is less than 17 then this value is assigned
        if (totalRoll < 17) {
            randomRolls[i] = totalRoll;
        }
        // If the total is 17, or 18 (gte 17) then we add an additional roll since the attribute is exceptional
        else {
            randomRolls[i] = totalRoll + (int)(Math.random()*(max-min+1)+min);
        }
    }

    /* JBLACK Manually set the value of the rolls to the corresponding rolls generated above */
    this.character.setPcIntelligenceQuotient(String.valueOf(randomRolls[0]));
    this.character.setPcMentalEndurance(String.valueOf(randomRolls[1]));
    this.character.setPcMentalAffinity(String.valueOf(randomRolls[2]));
    this.character.setPcPhysicalStrength(String.valueOf(randomRolls[3]));
    this.character.setPcPhysicalProwess(String.valueOf(randomRolls[4]));
    this.character.setPcPhysicalEndurance(String.valueOf(randomRolls[5]));
    this.character.setPcPhysicalBeauty(String.valueOf(randomRolls[6]));
    this.character.setPcSpeed(String.valueOf(randomRolls[7]));
}
```

The second example occurs during character class selection (different from the java Class type). The algorithm can be found in the ViewModel [PlayerCharacterClassSelectionActivity](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/PlayerCharacterClassSelectionActivity.java). In this example, there are minimum attribute requirements set forth by some of the classes that players may choose from. This algorithm takes the list of classes and compares the characters attributes to those requirements and provides back a list of available classes where the requirements have been met. The logic here is that the is the requirement is not met for any of the eight attributes, the application moves directly to the next class for consideration. If all requiremnts are met, then the character class is added to the list of available classes.

```java
private ArrayList<CharacterClass> determineAvailableClasses() {
    ArrayList<CharacterClass> characterClasses = dbHelper.getDBCharacterClassList();
    ArrayList<CharacterClass> availableClasses = new ArrayList<>();
    int pcIQ, pcME, pcMA, pcPS, pcPP, pcPE, pcPB;
    pcIQ = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcIntelligenceQuotient());
    pcME = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcMentalEndurance());
    pcMA = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcMentalAffinity());
    pcPS = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcPhysicalStrength());
    pcPP = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcPhysicalProwess());
    pcPE = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcPhysicalEndurance());
    pcPB = Integer.parseInt(character.getPcPhysicalBeauty());

    for (CharacterClass pcClass : characterClasses) {
        if (pcClass.getClassRequiredIQ() > pcIQ)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredME() > pcME)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredMA() > pcMA)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredPS() > pcPS)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredPP() > pcPP)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredPE() > pcPE)
            break;
        else if (pcClass.getClassRequiredPB() > pcPB)
            break;
        else
            availableClasses.add(pcClass);
    }

    return characterClasses;
}
```

For the transition from the inventory manager application to the Rifts Companion application, I implemented multiple new class structures to support different data components that are involved in character creation for the Rifts RPG game. These classes all implement getter/setter functionality for access control

## Databases
The adjustment to the inventory manager application for database structure was relatively straightforward. The number of tables were increased to support the different amounts of data that needed to be accessed by the program at different points in the character creation process. The tables contain significantly larger amounts of data compared to the inventory management program and I ended up creating a Java package with classes and methods dedicated to populating those tables provided they are not updated. 

When the [DBHelper](https://github.com/JBlackSNHU/JBlackSNHU.github.io/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/riftscompanion/DBHelper.java) class is initialized, it first performs a check to see if the different tables currently exist, and then creates them if they have do not. This is done by performing a "CREATE IF EXISTS" query on the database for each table. Below is an example of how the query is structured. 

```java
String skillTableCreateQuery = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME + " ("
                + SKILL_ID_COL + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "
                + SKILL_NAME_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_DESCRIPTION_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_CATEGORY_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL,"
                + SKILL_PROFICIENCY_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL + " INT, "
                + SKILL_PREREQUISITES_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_MODIFIER_COL + " TEXT DEFAULT NULL, "
                + SKILL_MODIFIER_VALUE_COL + " INT)";
```

I would point out that each table name, and the column names for each table are static String variables in the DBHelper class. This supports readability of the code and helps to prevent typos in any SQL queries by using the String variables rather than typing them in. 

The program then performs a check on each table to determine if it is empty or contains the data. This is shown in the following code. 

```java
private boolean isTableEmpty(String tableName) {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();
    boolean retval;
    Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(String.format("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s",tableName), null);
    cursor.moveToFirst();
    if (cursor.getInt(0) == 0)
        retval = true;
    else
        retval = false;

    cursor.close();
    return retval;
}
```

If the tables are empty, then the data is added to the table using the SQLiteOpenHelper functions using ContentValues and the SQLiteDatabase insert() function. Below is an example of the Skills table being populated using looping through the Skills List.

```java
public void PopulateSkillsTable() {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    SkillsData sd = new SkillsData();

    for (Skill skill : sd.getSkillsList()) {
        ContentValues values = new ContentValues();

        values.put(SKILL_NAME_COL, skill.getSkillName());
        values.put(SKILL_DESCRIPTION_COL, skill.getSkillDescription());
        values.put(SKILL_CATEGORY_COL, skill.getSkillCategory());
        values.put(SKILL_PROFICIENCY_COL, skill.getSkillProficiency());
        values.put(SKILL_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL, skill.getSkillProficiencyPerLevel());
        values.put(SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_COL, skill.getSkillSecondaryProficiency());
        values.put(SKILL_SECONDARY_PROFICIENCY_PER_LEVEL_COL, skill.getSkillSecondaryProficiencyPerLevel());
        values.put(SKILL_PREREQUISITES_COL, skill.getSkillPrerequisites());
        values.put(SKILL_MODIFIER_COL, skill.getSkillModifier());
        values.put(SKILL_MODIFIER_VALUE_COL, skill.getSkillModifierValue());

        db.insert(SKILL_TABLE_NAME, null, values);
    }
}
```

Lastly, data is accessed from the database using one of two different queries from the application. The first query returns all values contained in the specific table as in the below example for the Skills Table
```java
    public ArrayList<Skill> getDBSkillsList() {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ArrayList<Skill> skillsList = new ArrayList<>();

    Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME, null);
    int rowCount = cursor.getCount();
    if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
        do {
            skillsList.add(
                    new Skill(
                            cursor.getInt(0),       // Skill ID
                            cursor.getString(1),    // Skill Name
                            cursor.getString(2),    // Skill Description
                            cursor.getString(3),    // Skill Category
                            cursor.getInt(4),       // Skill Base Proficiency
                            cursor.getInt(5),       // Skill Proficiency Per Level
                            cursor.getInt(6),       // Skill Secondary Base Proficiency
                            cursor.getInt(7),       // Skill Secondary Proficiency Per Level
                            cursor.getString(8),    // Skill Prerequisites (comma delim)
                            cursor.getString(9),    // Skill Modifier
                            cursor.getInt(10)       // Skill Modifier value
                    )
            );
        } while (cursor.moveToNext());
    }
    cursor.close();
    return skillsList;
}
```

And the second query method is to return one or more entries contained in a comma delimmitted string passed as an argument to the method. This uses the SQL query "IN" method to dynamically select any matching entries for the skillname, but also able to return a single value. 

```java
    public ArrayList<Skill> getPartialDBSkillsList(String skillNames) {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ArrayList<Skill> skillsList = new ArrayList<>();

    // Reformat the skillNames string to support the IN function of SQL
    String skillNamesFormatted = skillNames.replace(",","','");
    String getSkillsQuery = "SELECT * FROM " + SKILL_TABLE_NAME + " WHERE " + SKILL_NAME_COL + " IN ('" + skillNamesFormatted + "')";
    Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(getSkillsQuery, null);
    if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
        do  {
            skillsList.add(
                    new Skill(
                            cursor.getInt(0),       // Skill ID
                            cursor.getString(1),    // Skill Name
                            cursor.getString(2),    // Skill Description
                            cursor.getString(3),    // Skill Category
                            cursor.getInt(4),       // Skill Base Proficiency
                            cursor.getInt(5),       // Skill Proficiency Per Level
                            cursor.getInt(6),       // Skill Secondary Base Proficiency
                            cursor.getInt(7),       // Skill Secondary Proficiency Per Level
                            cursor.getString(8),    // Skill Prerequisites (comma delim)
                            cursor.getString(9),    // Skill Modifier
                            cursor.getInt(10)       // Skill Modifier value
                    )
            );
        } while (cursor.moveToNext());
    }
    cursor.close();
    return skillsList;
}
```

The above method does not support partial matches, but could easily be modified to support partial match searching of the database. In future versions of this application, such functinonality will be implemented for general search parameters.
